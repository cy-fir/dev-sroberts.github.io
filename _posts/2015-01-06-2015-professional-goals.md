title: 2015 Professional Goals
---

The start of the year is a time for goals and plans. I've given it some thought and want to put mine out there for two reasons:

- To be held accountable. I know a couple people who may read this and chide me a bit for not keeping up. I can use that.
- In the hope that some people may join me in a couple of my goals.

## Goal 1: Read one technical book a month

> _“A capacity and taste for reading gives access to whatever has already been discovered by others.”_  - Abraham Lincoln

In 2014 I read the fewest technical books since getting done with college. This isn't a trend I want to see continue. My work life balance isn't what it used to be, but 12 books covering intelligence, security, and development in a year seems more than reasonable.

I've already gotten started with [Incident Response & Computer Forensics, Third Edition](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16691213-incident-response-computer-forensics-third-edition) by Jason T Luttgens, Matthew Pepe, & Kevin Mandia. Even better I'm reading this along with with [Alex Pinto](http://about.me/alexcpsec). I plan to post a _"book report"_ each one.

I'm also planning on reading:

- [Understanding Computation: From Simple Machines to Impossible Programs](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Computation-Machines-Impossible-Programs/dp/1449329276/ref=sr_1_1) by Tom Stuart
- [Thwarting Enemies at Home and Abroad: How to Be a Counterintelligence Officer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5979810-thwarting-enemies-at-home-and-abroad) by William Hood
- [The Art of Intelligence](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13590828-the-art-of-intelligence) by Henry A. Crumpton
- [Practical Malware Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Dissecting-Malicious/dp/1593272901) by Michael Sikorski & Andrew Honig
- [The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Flaws](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1914619.The_Web_Application_Hacker_s_Handbook) by Dafydd Stuttard

I'd love to continue having a discussion partner to work through each book with so feel free to reach out if any of these books peak your interest.

## Goal 2: Blog at least once a week

> _"Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing."_ - Benjamin Franklin

I've had this blog going for a little bit more than a year and honestly I'm a bit ashamed of how little is on it at this point. I think I can do better. Writing forces me to structure my thoughts and gives me a chance to explore ideas that require more than [140 characters](https://twitter.com/sroberts).

## Goal 3: Learn a System Programming Language

I write [Python](https://www.python.org) multiple times a week. Working at GitHub I see [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)/[Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) more than a bit. Between web frameworks and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) I write HTML/CSS/JS quite often. That said I haven't really spent time working on traditional system programming language since [C++](http://isocpp.org) in college (and that wasn't really a great experience).

While Python is a great Swiss Army Knife of a language there are times you need something more. Google's [Go](https://golang.org) certainly has gotten a lot of attention and apparently for good reason. It's highly performant, portable, and has a clean (dare I say Pythonic) syntax. It looks like a great language. I've also heard some great things about [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) as well ([this article](https://medium.com/@adamhjk/rust-and-go-e18d511fbd95) may sway me). Taking the time to learn and develop a project in a system language would round out a gap I have.

## Personal Goals
I'm not really keen on making this blog a LiveJournal but while I'm at it I may as well mention a couple personal goals as well:

- Read 12 cooking books this year. Currently I'm reading [Twelve Recipes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20721957-twelve-recipes) by Cal Peternell. Cooking more goes along with this of course.
- Complete the [C25K (Couch to 5k) program](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) and run regularly.
- I've been talking for awhile about getting a dog (my wife has had one since before we got married). I've never had a dog that was primarily mine and I think it would be a great experience and challenge to raise and train a dog myself.

It should be a great year.
